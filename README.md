# Notes App
Overview
The Notes App is a web application that allows users to create, update, and delete notes. It features a user-friendly interface built with React on the frontend, powered by an Express backend API I created. The data is stored efficiently in MongoDB.

# Technologies Used
Approach
Frontend: React

The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to manage their notes seamlessly.
State management in React is utilized for dynamic updates and smooth interactions.

Backend: Express & MongoDB
The Express backend provides a RESTful API for handling CRUD operations.
MongoDB is employed for efficient data storage and retrieval.

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/kaymone1/notesapp.git](https://github.com/Kaymone1/notesapp.git)
Navigate to the project folder: cd notes-app
Install dependencies:
Frontend: npm install
Backend:  npm install

Start the application:
Frontend: npm start
Backend: npm start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
